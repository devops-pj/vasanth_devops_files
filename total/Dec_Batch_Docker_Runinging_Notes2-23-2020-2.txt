==================
Docker 

Containarization Platfrom using which we can package our applications(code) & required softwares to run application in the form of
containers.

Build Once Run AnyWhere(Physical Machine,Virtural Machine,Cloud).

Docker has two editions:

Docker CE --> Community Edition(Open Source)
 
Docker EE --> Enterprise Edition(Commerical)

Components/Terminology:
=======================
Docker Image
Docker Container
Docker Registry(Repository)
  Public --> hub.docker.com (Public Accessable from anywhere)
  Private --> Can be accessable with in private network(Nexus,JFrog)
Dockerfile



docker build -t   <repoDetails>/<appName>:<version> . 

ex: 
# docker hub dockerhandson is username of my repo.Replace dockerhandson with your user name.
docker build -t dockrhandson/java-web-app:1 .
 
# Image tagged with rivate repo  
docker build -t 189.98.72.182:8081/java-web-app:1 .
	
# Authenticate with Repo
#Public Repo(docker hub)	
docker login -u <username> -p <password>

ex:

docker login -u dockerhandson -p password

#Private Repo
docker login -u <username> -p <password> <URL>	

docker login -u admin -p password 189.98.72.182:8081

# Docker push

docker push <repoDetails>/<appName>:<version>

# Image tagged with Public  Repo
docker push  dockrhandson/java-web-app:1

# Image tagged with Privare Repo
docker push 189.98.72.182:8081/java-web-app:1

	
docker run -d -p <hostPort>:<containerPort> --name <containerName> <imageName>

ex: 
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name javawebappcontainer dockerhandson/java-web-app:1

Image Commands:
==============
Docker Image:  It's package which will have all the required components like application                code & softwares which are required to run application. 

Base Images :  Software images which contains some software.Like  			 			                ubuntu,centos,tomcat,mysql,jenkins ..etc.
               
			   

Custom Images: We can create our own image using docker file on top of base image which  			   can have application code + Softwares.


Create a simple docker image from nginx

# Create one index.html
vi index.html
 
#Create Dockerfile(Default Name)

FROM nginx
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html


docker build -t <repodetails/appName:version> .

Ex:
docker build -t dockerhandson/testnginx .

#Tag image with private Repo

docker build -t 189.81.23.41:8081/testnginx .

# List images in the docker machine
docker images (or)  docker image ls


# Authenticat with Repo

# With public repo
docker login -u <userName> -p <password>

ex:
docker login -u username -p password

# With Private Rep
docker login -u <userName>. -p <password>.   <RepoURL>

ex:
docker login -u admin -p password 189.81.23.41:8081

# Push image to repo
docker push <repodetails/appName:version>

ex:
docker push dockerhandson/testnginx

# Download Image From Repo
docker pull <ImageId/Name>

#Delete Image from docker machine
docker rmi <ImageName/ImageID>

ex:
docker rmi dockerhandson/testnginx:latest

docker rmi <ImageName/ImageID> <ImageName/ImageID>

Delete all images
=================
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)

# It will also delete all unsued images
docker image prune

# It will delete all stopped containers ,all unused images,un used networks.
docker system prune

# Get more details about an image
docker image inspect <imageId/ImageName>
docker inspect <imageId/ImageName>

# Get Layers of an image
docker history <imageId/ImageName>


How can we move image from one system to another system with out repo?

1) # Save image as a tar file in source system where u have a image.
docker save <imageName> - o <FileName>.tar

2) SCP image tar file from source system to destination system
scp <FileName>.tar username@DestionationIP

3) In destination server execute docker load to load image from tar file.

docker load -i <FileName>.tar






docker build
docker push
docker login
docker images or docker image ls
docker images -q
docker rmi <imageId/Name>
docker rmi -f <imageId/Name>  <imageId/Name>
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
docker image prune
docker system prune
docker image inspect <imageId/Name>
docker inspect <imageId/Name>
docker history <imageId/Name>
docker search <imageName>
docker save
docker load


Contanier Commands
==================

# It will create container from the image but it will not start the container.

docker create --name <contaierName> - p <hostPort>:<containerPort> <imageName>


# It will create  & Start container from the image.
docker run -d --name <contaierName> - p <hostPort>:<containerPort> <imageName>

ex: 
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginxcontianer dockerhandson/testnginx

# List Running Containers
docker ps or docker container ls 

# List All Containers Running+Stopped
docker ps -a or docker container ls -a
docker ps --all or docker container ls --all

# List Only Stopped Contianers
docker ps -a --filter "status=exited"

# Inspect Container

docker container inspect <containerId/Name>
docker inspect <containerId/Name>

# Start Container
docker start <containerId/Name>

# Stop Container
docker stop <containerId/Name>

# Restart Container
docker restart <containerId/Name>

# Pause Container(It will pause container process)
docker pause <containerId/Name>

# Un Pause Container
docker unpause <containerId/Name>

Q) How can we copy files from HostSystem to Container or Container to HostSystem?

# Container to system
docker cp <containerName>:/<ContainerFilePath>  <SystemFileName>

# System to Cotnainer
docker cp <SourceFile/SystemFilePath> <containerName>:/<ContainerFilePath>

How can we troubleshoot or debug applications which are running as a conainers?

# It will disply Standard Out ,Standard Error Of Container terminal.
docker logs <containerName/Id>
docker logs --tail <NoLines> <containerName/Id>
docker logs -f <containerName/Id>


# It will display Memory/CPU Usage of a cotainer. 
docker stats <containerName/Id>
# It will process detials which is runing inside a container
docker top <containerName/Id>

# We can execute commands inside container
docker exec <ContainerID/Name> <Command>
ex:
  docker exec javawebapp pwd
  docker exec javawebapp ps
  
  docker exec javawebapp cat /etc/*releases
 
Q) How can we login or go inside into to container?

 docker exec -it <containerName/ID>  /bin/bash
 
 docker exec -it <containerName/ID>  bash
 
 docker exec -it <containerName/ID>  sh
 
# It will attach container process(terminal) to the host     	system  
docker attach <containerName/ID>


# We can create a image from the container.
docker commit <containerID/Name> <imageName>


# Remove Containers

# Below command can remove container if container is in stopped/exited state.
docker rm <containerID/Name>

# Below command can remove runinging container(Force Remove).
docker rm -f  <containerID/Name>

# How to remove all stopped containers
docker container prune
docker rm $(docker ps -aq --filter "status=exited")

# Remove Paused Containers
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq --filter "status=paused")

# Remove Paused Containers
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq --filter "status=paused")

# Remove All Containers
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)


# Who can we delete containers which are created from specific image?

docker ps -a|awk '$2=="<imageNameWithVersion>" {print  $1}' |xargs docker rm -f

Ex:

docker ps -a|awk '$2=="dockerhandson/java-web-app" {print  $1}' |xargs docker rm -f



22-Feb-2020 6:00 AM
===================
Monolothic --> Application Will be having a single code base.

Flipkart(Example)
Features
 --> SignUp
 --> SignIn
 --> CheckOut(AddToCart)
 --> Payments
 --> Orders
 --> MyAccount
 
It will generate only one build artifact.(war/ear) 

If Develepment is following Monolothic Architecture all the features(modules) will be part of same code base(Git Repo). Entire
application will be build as a single package.

Disadvantages:

1) Maintaince:

2) Deployment --> Eventhough there is smale change in one feature.Complete application has to rebuild,retest and deploy entire application.

2) Scaling: We will endup scaling entire application (all features) eventhough we want to scall one few features since all features are part of sample code base hence same build package.



MicroServcies --> Application Will be developed as collection of mutiple independent services ,having a multiple code bases.


 Flipkart
 Features
  --> SignUp --> Git Repo --> singup.jar/war --> DockerImage  --> Container
  --> SignIn --> Git Repo --> signin.jar/war --> DockerImage  --> Container
  --> CheckOut(AddToCart) --> Git Repo --> checkout.jar/war
  --> Payments --> Git Repo --> checkout.jar/war
  --> Orders  --> Git Repo --> checkout.jar/war
  --> MyAccount --> Git Repo --> checkout.jar/war
  

Dockerfile Keywords
==================
#Sample Dockerfile

FROM tomcat:openjdk-8
COPY target/*war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/java-web-app.war

Docker file keywords

FROM --> FROM indicates from which base image() you want to create your own image.

ex: 
(Only OS no Softwares)
FROM ubuntu 
FROM centos
FROM tomcat:openjdk-8 (OS + Java+Tomcat Sofwares)
FROM openjdk:8 (OS + Java8)
FROM nginx (OS + nginx)
FROM node (OS + node software)
FROM python(OS + python)

Note: In one docker file we can have more than one FROM keywords. But 99% In Dockerfile we will use only one FROM <baseimageName>. Base Image is dependson on what type of application we want to build&run as part of docker.


MAINTAINER --> It's depricated in latest versions. It's just info about who is maintaining/created the docker file. It's about author of dockefile.

ex: 
MAINTAINER  mihtuntechnologies@gmai.com

COPY --> It can copy files from host/local system(Where u are building an image) to image while creating an image.

ex:

COPY  <sourceFilePath>         <destinationPath>
      <Local/SystemFilePath>   <imagePath>

COPY target/java-web-app*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/java-web-app.war

ADD --> It can copy files from host/local system to an image. And also it can download files from remote http/s locations.

Ex:

ADD <sourceFilePath>  <destinationPath>

ADD <sourceFileHTTP/S URL> <destinationPath>

ADD target/java-web-app*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/java-web-app.war

ADD http://mirrors.estointernet.in/apache/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.51/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.51.tar.gz /opt/tomcat


RUN --> RUN keyword indicates the command that needs to be executed 
		 on the image. RUN keywords will be processed or executed  		 while creating a image. We can have n number of RUN keyword 
		 in a Dockerfile. All RUN keywords will be executed.
		 
EX:

RUN <command> (shell form)
Inside image your command will be processed like below.
/bin/sh -c command 
ex:

RUN mkdir -p /opt/tomcat

RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (Executable form)
Inside image your command will be processed like below.
/bin/executable  param1 param2

RUN ['mkdir', '-p', '/opt/tomcat']


RUN apt install git
RUN apt install vim


CMD --> CMD key word will indicate what command has to be executed 	while creating a container.We can have more than on CMD in 		docker file.But only latest/recent CMD will be executed.

CMD java -jar <jarName>
/bin/sh -c java -jar jarName

CMD ['java' , '-jar' , 'jarName']
/bin/java -jar jarName

ENTRYPOINT --> Entry Point also will get executed while creating a container. 

ENTRYPOINT java -jar jarName(ShellForm)
ENTRYPOINT ["java",'-jar' , 'Jarname'] (Executable Form)



22-Feb-2020 7:00 PM
===================

What is difference between CMD & ENTRYPOINT ?
CMD  can be overridden while creating a container. ENTRYPOINT can't be overrridden while creating a contianer.

Can we have both CMD & EntryPoint in a dockerfile?
Yes We can have both in a Dockerfile.If we have both CMD & EntryPoint. CMD will be passed as an argument for ENTRYPOINT.

We can use both CMD & ENTRYPOINT for below requirement.

Contaienr should run alywas same process(program) with defulat arguments . But dynamically i should be able to change arguments while creating a container. 

ENTRYPOINT["echo" , "FROM Dockerfile EntryPoint"]
CMD["ls" "/usr"]




Shell and Exec forms

All three instructions (RUN, CMD and ENTRYPOINT) can be specified in shell form or exec form. Let’s get familiar with these forms first.

RUN <command> (shell form)
RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form)

CMD <command> (shell form)
CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form)

ENTRYPOINT <command> (shell form)
ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form)

Shell form
<instruction> <command>

Examples:

RUN apt-get install python3
CMD echo "Hello world"
ENTRYPOINT echo "Hello world"

When instruction is executed in shell form it calls /bin/sh -c <command> under the hood and normal shell processing happens. For example, the following snippet in Dockerfile

ENV name John Dow
ENTRYPOINT echo "Hello, $name"

when container runs as docker run -it <image> will produce output

Hello, John Dow
Note that variable name is replaced with its value.


Exec form
This is the preferred form for CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions.

<instruction> ["executable", "param1", "param2", ...]

Examples:

RUN ["apt-get", "install", "python3"]
CMD ["/bin/echo", "Hello world"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "Hello world"]

When instruction is executed in exec form it calls executable directly, and shell processing does not happen. For example, the following snippet in Dockerfile

ENV name John Dow
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "Hello, $name"]
when container runs as docker run -it <image> will produce output

Hello, $name
Note that variable name is not substituted.


Note: 

Whether you're using ENTRYPOINT or CMD (or both) the recommendation is to always use the exec form so that's it's obvious which command is running as PID 1 inside your container.

•	You may also run into problems with the shell form if you're building a minimal image which doesn't even include a shell binary. When Docker is constructing the command to be run it doesn't check to see if the shell is available inside the container -- if you don't have /bin/sh in your image, the container will simply fail to start.
When using the shell form of either the ENTRYPOINT or CMD instruction.If we need to send any sort of POSIX(SIGKILL,SIGTERM,SIGSTOP) signals to the container since /bin/sh won't forward signals to child processes.

https://www.ctl.io/developers/blog/post/dockerfile-entrypoint-vs-cmd/



23-Feb-2020 6:00 AM
===================

EXPOSE

The EXPOSE instruction does not actually publish the port. It functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container, about which ports are intended to be published.

EX:
EXPOSE <port>

EXPOSE 8080

EXPOSE 8081

EXPOSE 3306

WORKDIR -->  We can set Working directory using WORKDIR key for  image/container.

ex: 

WORKDIR  /usr/local/tomcat



LABEL --> We can set labels(metadata) for an image using LABEL KeyWord.

Ex:

LABEL <key> <value>

LABEL branch develop

VOLUME --> VOLUME keyword will mount contianer file system to docker host file system. We will use Volume to take a back up of contianers file system.

EX: 

VOLUME <ContianerFolderPath>

VOLUME /var/lib/jenkins
VOLUME /data/db


USER  --> It will set USER for a image/container so that container will run as the given USER.

USER jenkins

USER nexus

ENV  --> It will set an environment varibale for an image.

ENV <key> <Value>

ex:

ENV JAVA_HOME /usr/local/java
ENV CATALINA_HOME /usr/local/tomcat


ARG --> We define argumetns so that we can refer any where in Dockefile and also we can dynamically pass argument values while creating an image.
ARG <key>=<value>


What are the best practices we should follow in Dockerfile?
1) Try to use alpine images where ever is possible.
2) Don't install unneccessary packages/softwares in Dockerimage.We should have
   only minimal packages/softwares which are required to be run our application.
3) Try to reduce number of layes as much as possible, by mereging muttiple run commands
   into a signle command whereever is possible.


Docker Networks
One cotnainer can to talk to another container if both contaienrs are in same docker network.

Docker has 3 types of networks by defualt.

# List Networks
docker network ls

1) dridge(default bridge)
2) host
3) none

While creating a container if we don't mention the docker network name containers will be created in default brige network. If containers are in defualt bridge network communication happens using only IP. Cotnainers can't access each other using cotnaienr name.


bridge
  default bridge
  custom bridge
  
host --> Container will be created in host network,we no need to do port publish/forword.Container          will not have ip.Can be accessable using System IP and port.

none --> Container will be created in none/null network.Container will not have ip.Can't be      		 accessable.



# Create Network
Syntax: docker network create -d <driver> <networkName>

Ex: 
docker network create -d bridge flipkartnetwork

# Inspect network
docker network inspect <networkNameOrId>

# Remove unused networks
docker network prune 

# Remove One or More Cotnainers
docker network rm <networkNameOrId>
Container to container communication can happen using Name(HostName)/IP in custom bridge.

Create containes in custom bridge

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name tomcatcotnainer --network flipkartnetwork dockerhandson/java-web-app

Create another container in same network and try to ping with name & IP from above container.

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name dbcontainer --network flipkartnetwork dockerhandson/java-web-app


docker inspect dockerhandson (Get IP)

Login to tomcatcotnainer and ping db container using name & IP to test connectivity.

docker login exec -it tomcatcotnainer
ping dockerhandson
ping <IP>




23-Feb-2020 7:00 PM
==================


Volumes:
=======

1) Create docker network using below commond(If it's not created already)

     docker network create  -d bridge flipkartnetwork

2) Create Spring Application Container in above network & which will talk to mongo data base container

     docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name springapp --network flipkartnetwork dockerhandson/spring-boot-mongo:latest

3) Create a mongo contianer with out volume in above network

     docker run -d --name mongo --network flipkartnetwork mongo
 
4) Access Spring application & insert data it will be inserted to mongo db. Delete and recreate mongo container 
   what ever you have inserted will no longer be availbale. As once we delete contaienr data also will be deleted
   in container.
   
   To take data backup from container we have to use volunmes
   
5) Create a volume a Local Volume(Execute docker volume ls to check existing volumes)

     docker volume create dbbackup
	 # To list volumes
	 docker volume ls
   
6) Use above volume while creating container.

     docker run -d --name mongo -v dbbackup:/data/db  --network flipkartnetwork mongo
   
7) Access Spring application & insert data it will be inserted to mongo db. Delete and recreate mongo container 
   with same volume mapping. You can see the data back.
   
   
    
 ===== Network Volumes Using AWS EBS==========
 
 1) Create IAM User with EC2 Full Access and user access key & Secret Key of the same. Replace your access key & secret below.

 docker plugin install rexray/ebs EBS_ACCESSKEY=AKIAZXQITIEDYDKJRX66 EBS_SECRETKEY=L5oxizF4AMqJ6nmsyErgssLohX4DpXVN/1Zn101k

 docker volume create --driver rexray/ebs --name ebsvolume

 docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongocontainer --network flipkartnetwork  -v ebsvolume:/data/db mongo



Docker Compose:

It's tool for defining and runing multicontainer applications.It's a yml file.

With Out Compose:

We have to run long docker run commands to deploy multi continer applications.


docker volume create -d <driver> <volumeName>

docker volume create -d local mongobackup

docker network create -d <driver> <networkNAme>

docker network create -d bridge springappnetwork


docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name springcontaienr --network springappnetwork dockerhandson/spring-boot-docker

docker run -d --name mongo --network springappnetwork -v mongobackup:/data/db mongo



With Compose

Install docker compose using below command:

sudo apt install docker-compose

We will define all the serivces(cotainers) details in compose file using compose file we can deploy multi container applications.


defautl name: docker-compose.yml or docker-compose.yaml

Example 1: (Volumes & Networks also will be created by docker compose)

version: '3.1' # Docker Comopose File Format Version

services:
  springapp:
    image: dockerhandson/spring-boot-mongo
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
    networks:
    - flipkartbridge
    container_name: springappcotnaienr

  mongo:
    image: mongo
    container_name: mongo
    networks:
    - flipkartbridge
    volumes:
    - mongobkp:/data/db

volumes:
  mongobkp:
         
networks:
  flipkartbridge:
     driver: bridge
	
Example 2: (Volumes & Networks will not be created by docker compose.As we set volumes and networks as external)
==========

version: "3.1"
services:
  springboot:
    image: dockerhandson/spring-boot-mongo
    container_name: springboot
    ports:
    - 8080:8080
    
  mongo: 
    image: mongo
    container_name: mongo
    volumes:
    - mongobackup:/data/db

volumes:
  mongobackup:
    external: true

networks:
  default:
   external:
    name: springappnetwork 

	
	
docker-compose conig
	
docker-compose up -d

docker-compose down	

Example 3: (Volumes & Networks will be created by docker compose.We can pass environment varibles to containers while creating if required).
