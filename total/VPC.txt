VPC --> Virtual Private Cloud

We have define Network Range(CIDR) For VPC.

CIDR --> Class Interdomain Routing. It's Alogorithm for
allocating IP Addresses for our network.

172.0.0.0/16 

                    32-n      32-16      16
Total No Of IPS = 2.      = 2        = 2   = 65536

172.0.0.0/24
                    32-n      32-24      8
Total No Of IPS = 2.      = 2        = 2   = 256

172.0.0.0/28
                    32-n      32-28      4
Total No Of IPS = 2.      = 2        = 2   = 16

Siderblock Range should be with in 16-28.


Subnets
 Private Subnet
 Public  Subnet

While Creating Subnet Also We have to define CIDR for subnet. It should be subset of VPC CIDR.

If my VPC CIDR is : 172.0.0.0/24 = 256

Total IPS Available for US = Total IPS - NoSubnets*5.

256-10= 246
If i plan my vpc with subnets my Subents CIDR will be like below.

Subnet One CIDR --> 172.0.0.0/25 = 172.0.0.0-172.0.0.127

Subnet Two CIDR --> 172.0.0.128/25 = 172.0.0.128-172.0.0.255

IGW  --> Internet GateWay.It's Virtual Router Which will enable internet connectivity to the VPC.

Route Table


Below Two Are Optional 

NAT --> Network Address Translator. Nat Instance will enable internet connectivity to private subnet servers. Nat instance should be created in public subnet. Assocaite NAT with Private Subnet in RT.


NACL --> Network Access Controll List. NACL is a fire at the subnet level.
